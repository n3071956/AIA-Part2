;===================================================


;these operators can have all of these slots...
;{ :name put-on
;  :achieves (on ?x ?y)
;  :when   ( (at ?x ?sx) (at ?y ?sy) (:guard (not= (? sx) (? sy))) )
;  :post   ( (protected ?sx) (protected ?sy)
;            (cleartop ?x)
;            (cleartop ?y)
;            (hand empty) )
;  :pre ()
;  :del ( (at ?x ?sx)
;         (cleartop ?y)
;         (protected ?sx)
;         (protected ?sy) )
;  :add ( (at ?x ?sy)
;         (on ?x ?y) )
;  :cmd ( (pick-from ?sx)
;         (drop-at ?sy) )
;  :txt (put ?x on ?y)
;  }
;
;NB: in this example the ops have unique :achieves + :when
;
;They are processed as follows...
;
;goal <- (pop goal-stack)
;match (:achieves op) goal
;  match (:when op) BD
;    push( expand op , goal-stack )
;    push-all( expand (:post op), goal-stack )
